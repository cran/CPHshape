Description: This package computes the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the shape-constrained hazard baseline and the effect parameters in the Cox proportional hazards model under IID sampling.  We assume that the data are continuous and allow for right censoring.  The function 'find.shapeMLE' allows for four different shape constraints: increasing, decreasing, unimodal, and u-shaped.
